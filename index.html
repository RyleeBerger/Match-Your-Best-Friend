    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p class= "mission">Match your Best Friend allows people to find their perfect pet through identifying their similar personality traits. Our mission is to help people be happy while having a happy and healthy relationship with their dog. Our organization is connected with adoption agencies as it will help prevent thousands if not millions of dogs from ending up in shelters. You can fill out our form to see what dogs are right for you based on your personality or you can go to our Breeds page and select images of dogs to see their information. We hope you find your perfect furry companion!</p><br></br>
